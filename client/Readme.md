npm install buffer

Here we have created a SetAvatar file to set avatar
We have used an external api in that file to load avatar 
Here user will change his avatar according to this api
we have used this api in such a way that everytime it will take different number and 
generate different avatar 

To load this avatar we have used buffer

To see how this avatar works we have declared a new route in App.js and named it in utils.js
