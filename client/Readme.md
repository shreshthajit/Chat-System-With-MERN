# Here I have implemented the following:
1.  If I click any user to chat with then it  will get selected with a color

# To do this:
1. I have created a onClick option and when I click any chat then we will pass the information to a function called changeCurrentChat and it will take the information
of selected Id and the information of that Id.

# In the Chat.js file
1. I have created a function called handleChatChange and it will be passed to the
Contact.js file by destructing and we will save the information of the currently selected
Id's information in the Contact.js file and finally will save in the Contact.js file
by changeChat parameter and it's corresponding activites that we have declared in the
Chat.js file
