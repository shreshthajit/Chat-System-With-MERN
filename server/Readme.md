 # Here I have implemented the following:
# When we will type message then it needs to be stored in the database and that's why
# We need new fuknctionalities in the server

 1. messagesController.js ---> addMessage and getMessage 
 2. messageModel.js
 3. messagesRoute.js --> addMessage and getMessage
 4. We have used our messagesRoute in index.js file
