# Here I have implemented the following:
1. I have made two component called Welcome.js and ChatContainer.js file to see and save it under Chat.js file.
2. If we click any user and there is no chat then it will show us Welcome.js section oterhwise ChatContainer.js

# Here we have faced an error and so we have declared a state called IsLoaded and if our Contacts get
# loaded then we can view the page
