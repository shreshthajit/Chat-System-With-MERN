# Here I have implemented the following:
1. I have Implemented the ChatContainer.js file and here we will see when we click a user of our chat what it should load
and how.
2. I have created Logout.js file and save it to ChatContainer.js file

# for logout icon:
# npm install react-icons


3. We have created a component called Logout.js
 and used handleClick because when we click it we will navigate to the login page
